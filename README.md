### What I Work On

I design platforms that must survive version churn, contributor turnover, and community scale.

My work spans:

- 🧠 Scalable architecture (Mautic, Drupal evolution, Symfony foundations)
- 🤖 Intelligent automation & NLP-based prediction systems
- 🔁 Contributor workflow and release reliability
- 🌍 Open-source governance & ecosystem sustainability
- 🧩 Pluggable, extensible platform design and architecture

I focus on building foundations that remain stable while everything around them changes.

---

### Selected Focus Areas

- Increasing contribution throughput and release stability in Mautic
- Designing governance-aware marketplace platforms
- Building NLP pipelines for clinical decision support (Ayurveda)
- Exploring distributed systems and Rust

---

### Foundation

- 18+ years in distributed engineering environments
- Experience across major Drupal architectural transitions
- Long-term open-source contributor and community organizer

---

### Philosophy

Clear architecture.  
Aligned incentives.  
Sustainable governance.

Software scales when its surrounding structure scales.

---

### Working Across Levels

I engage with people at very different stages — from students choosing their first stream to leaders designing long-term technology strategy.

- Students & parents: identifying direction beyond trends
- Engineers: growing from implementation to architectural thinking
- Product & business leaders: aligning incentives, architecture, and outcomes
- Educators & researchers: translating theory into deployable systems

Often, my role is not to give answers — but to help reveal the structure of the system in play.
