### What I Work On

I design technology platforms that must survive version churn, contributor turnover, and community growth.

My work spans:

- 🧠 Scalable architecture (Mautic, Drupal evolution, Symfony foundations)
- 🤖 Intelligent automation and applied NLP systems
- 🔁 Contributor workflow and release reliability
- 🌍 Open-source governance & ecosystem sustainability
- 🧩 Pluggable, extensible platform design and architecture

I focus on building foundations that remain stable while everything around them changes.

---

### Selected Focus Areas

- Increasing contribution throughput and release stability in Mautic
- Designing governance-aware marketplace platforms
- Building NLP pipelines for clinical decision support (Ayurveda)
- Embedding sustainability into platform design
- Exploring distributed systems as leverage for organizational scale

---

### Foundation

- 18+ years in distributed engineering environments
- Experience across major Drupal architectural transitions
- Long-term open-source contributor and community organizer

---

### Philosophy

Clear architecture.  
Aligned incentives.  
Sustainable governance.

Software scales when its surrounding structure scales.

---

### Working Across Levels

Technology decisions ripple far beyond code.

I engage across layers of experience and responsibility:

- Students & parents: identifying direction beyond short-term trends
- Engineers & contributors: growing from implementation to architectural thinking
- Product & business leaders: aligning incentives, architecture, and outcomes
- Educators & researchers: translating theory into deployable, scalable platforms

Often, my role is not to provide answers — but to surface the structure, trade-offs, and long-term implications within a system.
