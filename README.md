### What I Work On

I design systems that must survive version churn, contributor turnover, and community scale.

My work spans:

- 🧠 Scalable architecture (Mautic, Drupal 4.x → 8+ evolution)
- 🤖 Intelligent automation & NLP-based prediction systems
- 🔁 Contributor workflow & release velocity improvements
- 🌍 Open-source governance & ecosystem sustainability
- 🧩 Pluggable, extensible platform design

I focus on systems that outlive frameworks and version cycles.

---

### Selected Focus Areas

- Improving core contribution throughput and release reliability in Mautic
- Designing governance-aware marketplace platforms
- Building NLP pipelines for clinical decision support (Ayurveda)
- Exploring distributed systems and Rust

---

### Foundation

- 18+ years in distributed engineering
- Experience across major Drupal architectural shifts
- Long-term contributor in open-source communities

---

### Philosophy

Clear architecture.  
Aligned incentives.  
Sustainable governance.  

Software scales when the system around it scales.

---

### How I Help Across Levels

I work with people at very different stages — from students choosing their first stream to leaders designing long-term technology strategy.

- For students & parents: understanding *why* a path fits, not just what is trending
- For engineers: growing from implementation to system-level thinking
- For product & business leaders: aligning architecture, incentives, and outcomes
- For educators & researchers: translating theory into real-world systems

My role is often less about answers — and more about helping people see the system they’re operating in.
